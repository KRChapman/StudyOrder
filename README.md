- [ ]  Project: [100 Days of CSS](https://100dayscss.com/), scroll to the bottom of that page, beginning with #001, recreate the images, in CodePen.

https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d


Clone Spotify - you can sign up for a free account.
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)

You can use their API to search pretty much all of the data they have available:
[Spotify Web API]( https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/ ) 

You can't actually pull full length versions of the media to play in your app, just play the demo track ;)

- [ ] PUBLISH NPM MODULE
- [ ] RE_FACTOR TIC TAC TOE GAME WITH SMART AI USE MIN MAX ALGO

- [ ]CHROME EXTENSION Vigenere / Caesar Ciphers 

- [ ]Web Bot – An automated program which carries out tasks on the web including checking websites, page scraping, and summarization of data or web posting.

- [ ]REDDIT BOT
   Maybe question and answer bot filter maybe add ability to search for certain key word https://github.com/topielski/RedditBot/blob/master/redditbot.py

- [ ]Page Scraper – Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list. For added complexity, organize the indexed content and don’t allow duplicates. Have it put the results into an easily searchable index file.

- [ ]YOUTUBE PLAY LIST: POSSIBLE? TO MAKE A YOUTBE PLAY LIST WITH YouTube API/search client? FOR KARAOKE OR JUST PLAYING MUSIC?

- [ ] The easiest examples I could think of would be a library that does some math. Odds are the interviewer doesn't know how to do trig functions on a sphere, but it is something easy to look up and implement. You can describe it quickly. No amount of time will help them figure it out. Some people's eyes will just glaze over and they'll assume you're really smart (don't go into too much detail on these guys, show them your communication skills instead).

[link to reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6hff4n/what_makes_a_good_coding_portfolio/)
What would really impress me as a hiring employer (disclosure: I'm not, I'm a regular dev) 
would be if an applicant had made an actually useful, distributed and frequently downloaded tool/app/program that is maintained, documented and well-presented on a "real" website (or app store). Just to name a few examples, I'd respect people such as the devs who make Notepad2, IrfanView, PureText, or any other more or lesser known little tools. There are thousands of mobile apps that would be good examples also. Being able to code and maintain those, regardless of whether they're open source or not, shows a shitload more engagement into coding than tossing up some test projects on GitHub, or doing a few bug fixes and small contributions to an open source project, in my opinion.

Also, rest assured that there are millions of jobs out there where the employer doing 
the hiring hasn't even heard of GitHub or the concept of a coding portfolio.

## FAQ for this guide

### Why is it so much longer than the original Job Ready Guide?
What I've observed over the past 9 months is two phenomena, the first being that many "self-supplemented" with additional beginner projects and resources while working through YDKJS, so I expanded on the beginner section to alleviate the "but what else should I be doing" question. The second is that the most successful learners also supplemented with more involved projects towards the end of the guide, so I added more intricate/advanced projects to meet that need.

### Why so much Math and Algorithms?
It's not THAT much math, just through Precalculus so you won't feel so behind the curve when you want to push beyond just "Job Ready" and tackle more involved programming projects. The algorithms -- I've added them to ensure you're prepared and confident you can handle anything you might encounter in an interview.

### Where should I deploy my code?
For all projects - store your code on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket (GitHub preferred if you want it to later be seen by potential employers) and for web projects deploy the code on the web using the service of your choice ([GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) projects or [Surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) are ideal for frontend only projects, while Heroku is a free alternative for backend/fullstack).

### Why the change in Project selections?
To give you greater freedom, over the course of studying the guide, to create a portfolio that is unique to you - rather than a clone of the same exact projects that are on the portfolio of every other junior web dev out there.

### Do you have a list of helpful links to point me in the right direction if I need a productive break, or need to consult the official docs while I'm working through all this?
Yes, yes I do:
  - For when you need a quick/fun productive break that teaches you how to use CSS to layout a site (revisit this section in Tier 1 - Flexbox Zombies alone will prove extremely helpful learning to layout a page for the early projects.)

    # Get Job ready with 13 projects, 2 courses, and 10 books

Are you working through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and  want to be job ready (for a junior role) without finishing all three certifications? 
Want to short-circuit the process and get this done quick without getting laughed out of interviews?

Are you thinking "I'll just finish the frontend certification" and start applying?

**You're looking at the wrong certification** to get prepared and I'll tell you why. The frontend certification does NOT teach you any of the real world skills that go along with programming that you'll need on the job. It doesn't teach you how to work in an editor on your own machine. It doesn't teach you how to run a build process. It doesn't teach you how to share your code in a git repository. And, it doesn't teach you how to deploy your code to a real server on the net.

**Have no fear** there IS a FCC certification that will get you much, much closer to your goal. Combine it with just a few other resources and you can get there. The backend certification is the one you want to be aiming for. 

Finish this list - and you'll walk into interviews with a lot more confidence, and a much better chance of landing that job.

If you have any questions, be sure to check the [FAQ](./faq.md). In fact, before you even start anything, go read the FAQ. 
It has a pleathora of hints, tips and answers to help you ensure you get the most out of this guide.

#### If you're thinking @P1xt, you're nuts, I just want to be a frontend developer, this is too much
* No it's not.
* This will actually do what the frontend cert alone wont. It will prepare you to do the job of a frontend web developer in today's market. Writing some HTML and CSS isn't all there is to the job. This will prepare you for the rest
* Don't quit.
* Don't panic!
